Homemade Spaghetti Sauce is so full of flavor and it's easy to make it in large batches for freezing or canning for easy homemade meals that are prepared ahead.

Yield: about 8 cups

## Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large white onion, minced
- 5 cloves garlic, crushed
- ½ cup chicken broth
- 1 (28 ounce can) crushed tomatoes
- 1 (15 oz can) tomato sauce
- 1 (6 ounce can) tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 tablespoon fennel seeds
- 1 tablespoon ground oregano
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ cup chopped fresh basil
- ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions
Heat a large pot on the stove over medium high heat. Add in olive oil and saute onion in the olive oil for about 5 minutes, until softened. Add in 5 cloves and saute another 30-60 seconds.

Pour in chicken broth, crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, sugar, fennel, oregano, salt, pepper, basil, and parsley. Bring to a simmer.

Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 1-4 hours. Use an immersion blender to puree the mixture until the desired consistency is achieved, leaving it slightly chunky, or making it completely smooth.

## Notes
This recipe can be used in canning.

For easy long term storage, cool and then place into several gallon sized resealable freezer bags. Lay flat on a pan and place in the freezer until solid. Thaw and reheat in the microwave or on the stove to serve.
